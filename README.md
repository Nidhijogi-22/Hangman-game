# Hangman-game
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that tests your vocabulary and deductive skills. The objective is to guess a hidden word one letter at a time before the stick figure is completely drawn. Each incorrect guess adds a new part to the figure, and if it's fully drawn before the word is revealed, the game is lost.
